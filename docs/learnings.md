## feat/welcome (2026-05-01)

- **Git commits live in `.git/` locally — they're real before you push.** GitHub is just a hosted copy. `git push` is backup + share, not "make the commit count."
- **`git checkout -b` = create a branch *and* switch to it.** `-b` is `--branch`, the create flag.
- **`-u` on `git push` sets upstream tracking.** First push only; later pushes are just `git push`.
- **`as const` on a TS object literal** narrows the inferred types from `string` → exact literals. Combined with `keyof typeof`, that's how you get a union type of valid color names.
- **In RN, `borderRadius` clamps to half the element's width.** A 240 radius on a 390-wide View becomes 195 on each top corner — and two 195-radius quarter-circles meeting at the top-center give a tombstone dome, not a hill. Fix: extend the element past the screen edges + much larger radius. Only the gentle middle of the arc shows.
- **RN layout is bottom-anchored when actions are pinned to the bottom.** To move a sibling *up*, increase the gap *below* it (its `marginBottom`), not the space above it. Backwards from web instinct.
- **`StyleSheet` has no units.** Numbers are density-independent pixels; same physical size on iPhone SE and Pro Max.
- **`fontWeight` in RN is a string, not a number.** `'700'`, not `700`. Trips everyone up once.
- **`Text` can't sit directly inside a `View` as a string.** Always wrap in `<Text>`. Different from HTML.
- **Built-in `SafeAreaView` is the simpler version.** `react-native-safe-area-context` is the more capable replacement we'll swap in when the built-in misbehaves (landscape, side notches, custom inset positioning).
